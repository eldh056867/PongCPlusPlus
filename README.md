# üéÆ Pong Game in C++ with SFML

For next semester in university, we are starting to look at **C++**. Whilst for my entire computer science career the prospect of learning the language seemed daunting, I decided to do a small project for me to prepare for next semester, understand the underlying concepts of **C++** as well as make a fun tangible addition to my portfolio. This learning experience has been invaluable as it has taught me so much about the fundamentals of computer science, as well as how lower level languages function. This has definitly been the toughest lamguage I have learnt, coming from a **Java**, **C#** and **Python** background, but the flexibility and power over your program C++ gives has been an eye-opener. C++ is less forigiving as a language, and ensures the code you write must be **efficent** and **robust**. You are expected to handle **more** than other languages, however in return the knowledge you gain from it is much more in-depth than **Python** or **Java**. To help me, I have used the guides of ** The Cherno** on YT as well as other guides to make me understand some core concepcts related to the C family I was previously unfamiliar with, as well as looking back at my **Unity C#** code as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the process however, and this has opened my mind to other lower level languages I wish to explore more deeply such as **C** or even **X86 Assembly**.
