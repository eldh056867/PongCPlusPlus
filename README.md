cd pong-game
```

### Building the Project

1. **Compile the code** using your preferred C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ -c main.cpp Paddle.cpp Ball.cpp Game.cpp -I/path_to_sfml_include
   g++ main.o Paddle.o Ball.o Game.o -o pong-game -L/path_to_sfml_lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./pong-game
   ```
